## üéØ Key Implementation Details

### Snake Movement Logic
```javascript
// Snake moves on grid, direction changes only at valid times
// Body follows head in segments, growth adds new tail segment
// Collision detection checks all body segments and boundaries
```

### Multiplayer Architecture
```javascript
// Each player has independent Snake instance
// Shared food array accessible to all players
// Input manager routes controls to correct player
// Collision detection between different player snakes
```

### Power-up System
```javascript
// Timer-based temporary effects
// Visual indicators for active power-ups
// Different behavior modifications per power-up type
```

### Mobile Optimization
```javascript
// Touch controls with directional buttons
// Responsive canvas scaling
// Touch event prevention for game area
```
