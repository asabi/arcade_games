```

## Collision Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// Ball-paddle collision with angle calculation:
const hitPos = (ball.x - paddle.x) / (paddle.width / 2); // -1 to 1
const angle = hitPos * Math.PI / 3; // Max 60 degrees
ball.vx = Math.sin(angle) * ball.speed;
ball.vy = -Math.cos(angle) * ball.speed;
```
